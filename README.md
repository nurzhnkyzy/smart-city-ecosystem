# Smart City Digital Ecosystem

## Project Description
A unified digital platform that connects citizens, service providers, and city administrators to manage city service requests transparently.

## Problem
- Lack of transparency in city services
- Paper-based reporting without real confirmation
- Unclear deadlines for citizens
- No accountability of service providers

## Solution
- Single platform for all city requests
- Photo and geo-based confirmation
- Transparent deadlines and statuses
- Administrative control panel

## How It Works
1. Citizen submits a request
2. System assigns service provider
3. Provider uploads photo proof
4. Controller verifies completion
5. Citizen sees result

## Prototype
Web-based platform with mobile-friendly interface
